# XCryptor
Simple Text/File Encrypter/Decrypter
XCryptor is a powerful encryption tool that lets you securely encrypt text and files using advanced key derivation functions including Argon2id, PBKDF2, scrypt, and bcrypt. It employs Fernet symmetric encryption combined with SHA-256 hashing to ensure robust data protection.

Built as the full release successor to the beta Launchs Encryption Tool (https://github.com/Launcch/Launchs-SIMPLE-Encryption-TOOL), XCryptor provides a user-friendly interface and enhanced security features for all your encryption needs.

This marks the complete release of the tool. Future updates are unlikely unless critical bugs are reported that require fixing.
Instructions:
1. Importing Files or Text

To encrypt a file, click the “Import File” button and browse to select the desired file.

To encrypt text, simply type or paste your text into the input text box.

You can also drag and drop files or text directly into the input area for quick import.

2. Choosing Encryption Settings

Select your preferred Key Derivation Function (KDF) from the options: Argon2id, PBKDF2, scrypt, or bcrypt.

Enter a strong password for encryption. You may leave this blank if you want passwordless encryption.

The tool uses Fernet encryption combined with SHA-256 hashing automatically.

3. Encrypting Data

After importing your file or entering text and setting your password/KDF, click the “Encrypt” button.

The encrypted output will appear in the output text box.

You can save the encrypted data as a text file by clicking the “Save Encrypted File” button.

4. Decrypting Data

To decrypt, either import an encrypted file or paste the encrypted text into the input box.

Enter the correct password if the data was password-protected.

Click the “Decrypt” button.

The decrypted text or file content will be displayed in the output box.

Save the decrypted file or copy the text as needed.

5. Saving and Exporting

Use the “Save” buttons to export your encrypted or decrypted files to your desired location.

You can also copy the text output to your clipboard for easy sharing or storage.
