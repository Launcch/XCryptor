# XCryptor
Simple Text/File Encrypter/Decrypter
XCryptor is a powerful encryption tool that lets you securely encrypt text and files using advanced key derivation functions including Argon2id, PBKDF2, scrypt, and bcrypt. It employs Fernet symmetric encryption combined with SHA-256 hashing to ensure robust data protection.

Built as the full release successor to the beta Launchs Encryption Tool (https://github.com/Launcch/Launchs-SIMPLE-Encryption-TOOL), XCryptor provides a user-friendly interface and enhanced security features for all your encryption needs.

This marks the complete release of the tool. Future updates are unlikely unless critical bugs are reported that require fixing.
